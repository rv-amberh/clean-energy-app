## Instructions to Run App

1. To begin, open a new terminal and ``cd`` inside the main project folder.
2. Next, run``npm install`` in the terminal to install the required node modules and their dependencies. 
3. Once the installation is complete, the backend folder's package.json file will also need the node modules installed. 
4. Open another new terminal and ``cd`` into the folder labeled ``backend``. Run ``npm install`` again. 
4. Run ``node server.js`` in the same terminal to spin up the back end. If the console.log statements print to the terminal, the installation has been successful.
5. Switch to the terminal with the main project folder open and run ``npm run start`` to launch the front end.
